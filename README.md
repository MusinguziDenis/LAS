This repo provides an implementation of the Listen Attend and Spell model that transcribes speech utterences to characters. The model is composed of a  listener and a speller. The listener is a pyramidal recurrent network encoder that accepts filter bank spectra as inputs. The speller is an attention-based recurrent network decoder that emits characters as outputs. The model uses greeedy decoding. The full paper can be found here https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01211. File structure: - main.py - models.py - train_test.py - dataloader.py
